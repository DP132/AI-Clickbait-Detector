# AI-Clickbait-Detector
This project implements two machine learning approaches for detecting clickbait headlines:

1.Traditional NLP (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)

2.Deep Learning (DistilBERT)

Key Takeaways:
  BERT outperforms TF-IDF by 2% in accuracy (99% vs 97%).
  
  Minimal false positives/negatives in BERT:
    
  Only 62 news headlines misclassified as clickbait.
    
  Only 51 clickbait headlines misclassified as news.
  
  TF-IDF remains strong for lightweight applications with 97% accuracy.
